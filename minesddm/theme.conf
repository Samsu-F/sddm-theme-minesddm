#### passwordMode controls if and how the password is masked. The available password modes are: ####
# plain         - Do not mask the password and show it in plain text
# fixedMask     - Mask the password with passwordFixedMaskString cut to the same length as the entered password,
#                 repeating passwordFixedMaskString if the entered password is longer than the former.
# noEcho        - Display nothing.
# randomMask    - Mask the password with a randomly generated string cut to the same length as the entered password.
# jitterMask    - Same as randomMask, but randomize the masking string on each input update.

# passwordFixedMaskString can be arbitrarily long but it must not be the empty string

####################################################
# Making it look as close to Minecraft as possible #
####################################################
# Here are some recommendations that could be useful if you want
# this theme to match the look of Minecraft as closely as possible:

# mainTitleText = "Create New World"
# usernamePlaceholder = ""
# usernameBottomLabel = "Will be saved in: {username}"
# usernameBottomLabelIfEmpty = "Will be saved in: World"
# passwordTopLabel = "Seed"
# passwordPlaceholder = ""
# passwordBottomLabel = "Leave blank for a random seed"
# passwordBottomLabelIfEmpty = "Leave blank for a random seed"
# sessionText = "Game Mode: {sessionname}"
# textLoginButton = "Create New World"
# textPowerOffButton = "Cancel"
# passwordMode = randomMask

# Depending on the length of your password, you might want to set maskCharsPerTypedChar
# to some value >1 to make it look like you are entering a longer seed.
